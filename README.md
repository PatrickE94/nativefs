# NativeFS

Replacement functions for filesystem interactions with performance in focus.

## Copy
Progress callback is optional. Progress callback is run at every 1% change.
I.e. every 10th bytes copied of a 1000 bytes large file will trigger a progress update.

```
var nativefs = require('nativefs');

nativefs.copy('original_file', 'target_file', function(copied, total) {
    console.log('Copied ' + copied + ' of ' + total);
}, function(err, result) {
  if (err) throw err;
  // result is always true if there is no error, basically useless argument.
});
```
